I am a doctoral candidate in Statistics, scheduled to defend my PhD on September 13, 2024. My thesis, titled "Shrinkage Estimation Methods for Mixed Data Sampling Regression and Heterogeneous Autoregressive Models," focuses on Econometrics. I primarily work on Mixed Data Sampling Regression, a technique that addresses frequency mismatches between dependent and independent variables. Additionally, I explore shrinkage estimation methods and machine learning techniques for estimating and forecasting macroeconomic variables, including volatility forecasting. I also have experience with geostatistical techniques for predicting environmental variables and occasionally contribute to biostatistics-related projects for fun.

My supervisors are Professor Pär Sjölander, Professor Kristofer Månsson at JIBS, Jönköping University, and Professor B.M. Golan Kibria from Florida International University, United States of America.
